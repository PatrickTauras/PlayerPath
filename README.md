# PlayerPath

## Overview
PlayerPath is an exciting daily game that blends the thrill of basketball with the challenge of puzzle-solving, inspired by popular games like The New York Times' 'Wordle' and 'Connections'. It’s designed specifically for basketball enthusiasts who love the NBA and enjoy testing their knowledge of players' career paths.

In PlayerPath, your task is to guess the **Current or Former NBA player** based on the sequence of NBA teams they’ve played for. Each correct guess reveals a new team, bringing you closer to identifying the player. It’s a fun and educational way to engage with the history of the NBA, and a perfect daily challenge for fans.

## How to Play

### Objective:
Guess the NBA player by identifying the teams they have played for throughout their career. The game will present you with a sequence of team logos, one for each team the player has played for.

### Gameplay:
- At the start of each new day, a new NBA player is featured. The game begins by displaying the first and last teams the player has played for in their career.
- Your goal is to guess the player's name based on these initial team logos.
- Each guess reveals the next team the player played for in sequence, continuing until all teams are revealed or the player is correctly identified.
- You only get 8 guesses to correctly identify the player. If you run out of guesses, the game ends.
- Use the provided hints or toggle switches if you’re having trouble figuring out the player.

### Example: LeBron James
- Suppose the game starts with the team logos of the Cleveland Cavaliers (the first team) and the Los Angeles Lakers (the last team).
- You guess a player, but if the guess is incorrect, the game reveals the next team LeBron James played for, the Miami Heat.
- The sequence continues, revealing more teams with each guess, until you either correctly identify the player or use up all 8 guesses.

# PlayerPath

## Overview
PlayerPath is an exciting daily game that blends the thrill of basketball with the challenge of puzzle-solving, inspired by popular games like The New York Times' 'Wordle' and 'Connections'. It’s designed specifically for basketball enthusiasts who love the NBA and enjoy testing their knowledge of players' career paths.

In PlayerPath, your task is to guess the **Current or Former NBA player** based on the sequence of NBA teams they’ve played for. Each correct guess reveals a new team, bringing you closer to identifying the player. It’s a fun and educational way to engage with the history of the NBA, and a perfect daily challenge for fans.

## How to Play

Guess the NBA player by identifying the teams they have played for throughout their career. The game will present you with a sequence of team logos, one for each team the player has played for.

### Gameplay:

### Example:
